# Mortgage calculator
I've created a mortgage calculator that calculates and displays monthly payments, interest and amortization based on user inputs.

How to use the mortgage calculator
1. Open the terminal or command prompt and go to the directory where the source code files (the source code should be in a folder called mortgageCalculator) are located (example: cd Desktop)
2. Compile the source code MortgageController by entering javac mortgageCalculator/MortgageController.java
3. Run the course code by entering java mortgageCalculator/MortgageController 
4. The program should run and the mortgage calculator should pop up 
5. Perform the desired actions with the calculator
